### Reddit Context
- **Post ID:** 1l7z7k4
- **Title:** 7Hcp - played in my state's AM qualifier.  AMA
- **URL:** https://reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1l7z7k4/7hcp_played_in_my_states_am_qualifier_ama/
- **Subreddit:** golf
- **Content:**
  > I'm 40 and have never played a competitive round of golf in my life and when my GHIN index dipped below 8 after a few good rounds, I got a notification from my state's golf assn that I would be eligible to register for my state's AM qualifier.  I knew I would not be competitive and just resolved to have a good time and not get yanked off the course after 9.
  >
  > The club was private but allowed practice rounds which was cool. I took advantage and played the day before and made notes.  It was relatively easy (3200 yds) from the tips on the front and then absolutely bonkers long (3,750) from the tips on the back 9 for 36/36.
  >
  > Day of, I was paired with a kid who is in high school, is +1.2 and had never played the course before. His drives were effortlessly long.  He had knockdowns, draws, punches, spins, cuts, and anything else in his bag you could imagine.  He shot even and qualified for the state AM.  I asked him if he played in the Open qualifiers and he did, and was 8 shots off the cut line.  For a kid to be +1.2 and 8 SHOTS off the cut for an Open qualy is nuts.
  >
  > It went well for a few holes and I was +1 thru 5 but unfortunately I had a ball go 1' long on a long par-3 and get hung up on a backstop behind the hole.  Made bogey when my tap on ran 12' past the hole and I missed the comebacker.  Next hole, I lost a ball in a somewhat open area with some sparse trees and had to re-tee making a snowman but did recover with a birdie and shot 43 on the front.  My game is predicated on playing predictable, trouble-avoiding golf rather than birdie hunting so a snowman is something that's tough to recover from.  A monsoon came on hole 15, and not wanting to wait 2 hours to finish, I called it a day and WD.  I highly suggest anyone who can qualify for a state Am to go for it.  The club's members and residents also hung out beside the fairways and followed some of the groups around in carts so that was a cool touch too.

### Content Summary
> The Reddit users are discussing their experiences in competitive golf, highlighting the significant increase in difficulty and the accompanying nerves they felt during the tournaments. They express the thrill and fulfillment they found in competition despite their performances -- some even exceeded the limit by a large margin, which led to potential disciplinary action. Playing competitively was also described as a solitary experience, especially for those without a caddie. Despite the challenges, they plan to continue participating in such tournaments.

### Design Description
> A vector illustration of a golfer in mid-swing, with a backdrop of a sprawling golf course stretching out behind him. The course is split into two parts symbolizing the front and back 9 - the nearer half is softer in color and simpler, representing the 'relatively easy' front part and the farther half is vibrant with profound features showing the 'bonkers long' back part. A faint image of a monsoon cloud is visible on the top corner, referencing the weather condition on hole 15 and raindrops are subtly incorporated into the background design. In the sky on the right side of the illustration, the silhouette of a high-school-aged golfer can be seen driving effortlessly long shots, symbolizing the young competition. A sequence of footprints is seen, moving from the golfer to the hole, representing the journey of the player in the competition. The text "State AM Qualifier - Embrace Your Journey" is placed above the image in an elegant golf-themed font.

### Reddit Context
- **Post ID:** 1l8xbol
- **Title:** Riggs the 4hc…
- **URL:** https://reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1l8xbol/riggs_the_4hc/
- **Subreddit:** golf
- **Content:**
  > Riggs the so called 4hc got beat by a 15hc and 10hc. Being this was Oakmont from the Tips— this should have made the hc difference even greater. Statically, Riggs should have beat them both. It just amazes me he still claims a single digit HC… dude has the biggest vanity hc in golf history

### Content Summary
> The Reddit comments discuss a person named Riggs, who seems to play golf and posts about his games. However, the commenters doubt the authenticity of his scores suggesting that he only reports his best games while hiding poor scores. Some also demand to see his performance in a $25k match, implying Riggs might avoid such a challenge.

### Design Description
> A simplified illustration of a golf field, the sun setting behind it. In the center, a triumphant golfer raises his club after hitting a winning shot, his small figure silhouette against the backdrop of the giant challenging Oakmont course. Behind him, a larger figure - representing the 'so called' 4hc golfer - stands dejectedly. Their golf club is faintly depicted as a 'vanity mirror', humorously alluding to the vanity hc in golf history.

## Development

This project uses a Makefile to simplify common development tasks:

```bash
make venv      # Create Python virtual environment
make install   # Install dependencies
make test      # Run test suite
make run       # Run the app locally
make run-full  # Run the complete end-to-end pipeline
make clean     # Clean up development artifacts
```

### Example Commands

Run the full pipeline with DALL-E 2 (default):
```bash
make run
```

Run the full pipeline with DALL-E 3:
```bash
make run MODEL=dall-e-3
```

Generate an image with a custom prompt using DALL-E 2 (default):
```bash
make run-generate-image IMAGE_PROMPT="A cat playing chess" MODEL=dall-e-2
```

Generate an image with a custom prompt using DALL-E 3:
```bash
make run-generate-image IMAGE_PROMPT="A cat playing chess" MODEL=dall-e-3
```

### Command Line Options

The application supports different modes of operation:

```bash

## License

MIT 

## Zazzle Product Designer Agent

The Zazzle Product Designer Agent is responsible for generating custom products on Zazzle based on instructions received from the Reddit agent. This agent utilizes the Zazzle Create-a-Product API to design and create products dynamically.

### Initial Focus: Custom Stickers

The initial focus of the Product Designer Agent is on creating custom stickers. The agent will:

- Receive design instructions from the Reddit agent
- Use the Zazzle Create-a-Product API to generate custom sticker designs
- Ensure proper URL encoding of product parameters
- Handle dynamic text and color customization

### Integration with Reddit Agent

The Product Designer Agent works in conjunction with the Reddit agent to:

- Process LLM-generated product ideas
- Generate product designs based on the context and relevance of the conversation
- Create and list the products on Zazzle for potential sales

### Future Enhancements

In the future, the Product Designer Agent can be expanded to include other product types and design options, allowing for a broader range of custom products to be generated based on Reddit interactions.

## Reddit Agent Voting and Commenting

The Reddit agent can interact with posts and comments in several ways:

- **Voting**: Upvote and downvote both posts and comments
  - `test-voting`: Upvotes and downvotes a trending post in r/golf
  - `test-voting-comment`: Upvotes and downvotes a comment in a trending post, printing the comment text, author, link, and action taken for manual verification

- **Commenting**: Comment on posts (test mode only)
  - `test-post-comment`: Simulates commenting on a trending post, printing the proposed comment text, post details, and action for manual verification
  - In test mode, comments are not actually posted to Reddit, but the system shows what would be posted 

- **Marketing Commenting**: Reply to comments with marketing content (test mode only)
  - `test-marketing-comment-reply`: Simulates replying to a top-level comment in a trending post with a marketing message, printing the proposed reply text, product information, and action for manual verification. 

## Pipeline Behavior

- The pipeline now expects `RedditAgent.get_product_info()` to return a list of `ProductInfo` objects, not `ProductIdea` objects. This means the pipeline processes fully-formed product information directly, rather than generating ideas and then transforming them.
- Error handling: If a downstream error occurs (such as affiliate link generation failure), the pipeline will raise an exception. Tests should expect exceptions in these cases.

## Running Tests

To run all tests and check coverage, use:

```
make test
```

This will run the full suite and report coverage for the `app/` directory.
