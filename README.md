*Transform Reddit trends into commissioned products with AI-powered automation.*

## How Clouvel Works

### Commission Workflow

1. **Browse Products**: Users view the product grid showing generated items from trending Reddit posts
2. **Commission Request**: Users select a product and choose a commission tier ($25, $50, or $100)
3. **Secure Payment**: Stripe checkout processes the payment securely
4. **Task Queue**: Commission is added to the processing queue with real-time progress tracking
5. **AI Generation**: Reddit content is analyzed, product ideas generated, and images created using DALL-E 3
6. **Product Creation**: Zazzle products are automatically created with affiliate links
7. **Completion**: Users receive their commissioned product with purchase links

### Technical Implementation

- **Task-Based Processing**: All product generation uses a queue-based system with retry logic
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket connections provide live progress updates during commission processing  
- **Secure Payments**: Stripe handles all payment processing with webhook confirmation
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT models analyze Reddit content and DALL-E 3 generates product images
- **Automated Publishing**: Products are automatically posted to relevant subreddits with affiliate tracking
