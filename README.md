### Reddit Context
- **Post ID:** 1l8xbol
- **Title:** Riggs the 4hc…
- **URL:** https://reddit.com/r/golf/comments/1l8xbol/riggs_the_4hc/
- **Subreddit:** golf
- **Content:**
  > Riggs the so called 4hc got beat by a 15hc and 10hc. Being this was Oakmont from the Tips— this should have made the hc difference even greater. Statically, Riggs should have beat them both. It just amazes me he still claims a single digit HC… dude has the biggest vanity hc in golf history

### Comment Summary
> The Reddit comments discuss a person named Riggs, who seems to play golf and posts about his games. However, the commenters doubt the authenticity of his scores suggesting that he only reports his best games while hiding poor scores. Some also demand to see his performance in a $25k match, implying Riggs might avoid such a challenge.

### Design Description
> A simplified illustration of a golf field, the sun setting behind it. In the center, a triumphant golfer raises his club after hitting a winning shot, his small figure silhouette against the backdrop of the giant challenging Oakmont course. Behind him, a larger figure - representing the 'so called' 4hc golfer - stands dejectedly. Their golf club is faintly depicted as a 'vanity mirror', humorously alluding to the vanity hc in golf history.

## Development

This project uses a Makefile to simplify common development tasks:

```bash
make venv      # Create Python virtual environment
make install   # Install dependencies
make test      # Run test suite
make run       # Run the app locally
make run-full  # Run the complete end-to-end pipeline
make clean     # Clean up development artifacts
```

### Example Commands

Run the full pipeline with DALL-E 2 (default):
```bash
make run
```

Run the full pipeline with DALL-E 3:
```bash
make run MODEL=dall-e-3
```

Generate an image with a custom prompt using DALL-E 2 (default):
```bash
make run-generate-image IMAGE_PROMPT="A cat playing chess" MODEL=dall-e-2
```

Generate an image with a custom prompt using DALL-E 3:
```bash
make run-generate-image IMAGE_PROMPT="A cat playing chess" MODEL=dall-e-3
```

### Command Line Options

The application supports different modes of operation:

```bash

## Zazzle Product Designer Agent

The Zazzle Product Designer Agent is responsible for generating custom products on Zazzle based on instructions received from the Reddit agent. This agent utilizes the Zazzle Create-a-Product API to design and create products dynamically.

### Initial Focus: Custom Stickers

The initial focus of the Product Designer Agent is on creating custom stickers. The agent will:

- Receive design instructions from the Reddit agent
- Use the Zazzle Create-a-Product API to generate custom sticker designs
- Ensure proper URL encoding of product parameters
- Handle dynamic text and color customization

### Integration with Reddit Agent

The Product Designer Agent works in conjunction with the Reddit agent to:

- Process LLM-generated product ideas
- Generate product designs based on the context and relevance of the conversation
- Create and list the products on Zazzle for potential sales

### Future Enhancements

In the future, the Product Designer Agent can be expanded to include other product types and design options, allowing for a broader range of custom products to be generated based on Reddit interactions.

## Reddit Agent Voting and Commenting

The Reddit agent can interact with posts and comments in several ways:

- **Voting**: Upvote and downvote both posts and comments
  - `test-voting`: Upvotes and downvotes a trending post in r/golf
  - `test-voting-comment`: Upvotes and downvotes a comment in a trending post, printing the comment text, author, link, and action taken for manual verification

- **Commenting**: Comment on posts (test mode only)
  - `test-post-comment`: Simulates commenting on a trending post, printing the proposed comment text, post details, and action for manual verification
  - In test mode, comments are not actually posted to Reddit, but the system shows what would be posted 

- **Marketing Commenting**: Reply to comments with marketing content (test mode only)
  - `test-marketing-comment-reply`: Simulates replying to a top-level comment in a trending post with a marketing message, printing the proposed reply text, product information, and action for manual verification. 

## Pipeline Behavior

- The pipeline now expects `RedditAgent.get_product_info()` to return a list of `ProductInfo` objects, not `ProductIdea` objects. This means the pipeline processes fully-formed product information directly, rather than generating ideas and then transforming them.
- Error handling: If a downstream error occurs (such as affiliate link generation failure), the pipeline will raise an exception. Tests should expect exceptions in these cases.

## Running Tests

To run all tests and check coverage, use:

```
make test
```

This will run the full suite and report coverage for the `app/` directory.
