### 1. api.py (59KB, 1602 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This file contains all the active API endpoints and is heavily used.

**Active Endpoints**:
- `/health` - Health check
- `/api/generated_products` - Get all generated products
- `/redirect/{image_name}` - Redirect to product
- `/api/product/{image_name}` - Get product by image name

- `/api/publish/*` - Product publishing endpoints
- `/ws/tasks` - WebSocket for task updates

**Dependencies**: Uses most core services and models
- StripeService
- CommissionValidator
- SubredditService
- SubredditTierService
- TaskQueue
- TaskManager
- WebSocketManager
- SubredditPublisher

**Conclusion**: This is the main API file and contains all active endpoints. No cleanup needed.

### 2. commission_worker.py (29KB, 680 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This is the core commission processing worker used in K8s jobs.

**Active Functionality**:
- Complete commission workflow processing
- Donation validation and processing
- Product generation for commissions
- Task status updates
- Redis WebSocket integration
- Zazzle product creation

**Dependencies**: Uses most core components
- RedditAgent
- ContentGenerator
- ImageGenerator
- ZazzleProductDesigner
- ZazzleAffiliateLinker
- ImgurClient
- CommissionValidator
- Redis service

**Conclusion**: This is the main commission worker and is actively used. No cleanup needed.

### 3. main.py (12KB, 327 lines) - ⚠️ PARTIALLY ACTIVE - SOME CLEANUP POSSIBLE

**Status**: Contains both active and legacy functionality.

**Active Parts**:
- Database initialization
- FastAPI app export for Uvicorn
- Basic logging setup

**Legacy/Unused Parts**:
- `run_full_pipeline()` function - This appears to be legacy pipeline code that's not used by the commission worker
- `run_generate_image_pipeline()` function - Standalone image generation, not used in commission workflow
- `save_to_csv()` function - Legacy CSV export functionality
- `log_product_info()` function - Legacy logging
- `ensure_output_dir()` function - Legacy directory setup
- `validate_subreddit()` function - Legacy validation
- Command line argument parsing for standalone pipeline execution

**Dependencies**: Imports many legacy components that may not be needed
- Pipeline class (legacy)
- RedditAgent (legacy usage)
- ContentGenerator, ImageGenerator, etc. (legacy usage)

**Potential Cleanup**:
- Remove legacy pipeline execution functions
- Remove CSV export functionality
- Remove standalone image generation
- Keep only database init and FastAPI export
- Could reduce from 327 lines to ~50-100 lines

### 4. pipeline.py (29KB, 690 lines) - ❌ LEGACY - MAJOR CLEANUP POSSIBLE

**Status**: This appears to be legacy pipeline code that's been replaced by the commission worker.

**Legacy Functionality**:
- `Pipeline` class - Complete pipeline orchestration
- `process_product_idea()` - Individual product processing
- `run_pipeline()` - Full pipeline execution
- `run_task_pipeline()` - Task-based pipeline execution
- `run_task_pipeline_specific()` - Specific task pipeline
- `check_task_queue_first()` - Task queue checking

**Dependencies**: Uses many components that may be duplicated in commission_worker.py
- RedditAgent
- ContentGenerator
- ImageGenerator
- ZazzleProductDesigner
- ZazzleAffiliateLinker
- ImgurClient

**Analysis**: This appears to be the old pipeline system that has been replaced by the commission worker. The commission worker handles the same functionality but in a more focused way for commissioned products.

**Potential Cleanup**: This entire file could potentially be removed if the commission worker has completely replaced this functionality. However, need to verify that no API endpoints or other parts of the system still reference this pipeline.

### 5. task_manager.py (14KB, 311 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This appears to be actively used for task management.

**Active Functionality**:
- Task creation and management
- Task status tracking
- Task execution coordination
- Redis integration for task updates

**Dependencies**: Used by API endpoints and commission worker
- TaskQueue
- Redis service
- Database models

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 6. task_queue.py (12KB, 338 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This appears to be actively used for task queuing.

**Active Functionality**:
- Task queue management
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Task persistence and retrieval
- Queue status monitoring

**Dependencies**: Used by task manager and API endpoints
- Database models
- Redis service

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 7. task_runner.py (8.4KB, 230 lines) - ❌ LEGACY - POTENTIAL CLEANUP

**Status**: This appears to be legacy task running code.

**Legacy Functionality**:
- Task execution logic
- Pipeline task processing
- Task status updates

**Analysis**: This seems to be replaced by the commission worker and task manager. The commission worker handles task execution directly.

**Potential Cleanup**: This file could potentially be removed if the commission worker has replaced this functionality.

### 8. subreddit_publisher.py (14KB, 375 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This is actively used for publishing products to Reddit.

**Active Functionality**:
- Product publishing to r/clouvel subreddit
- Database integration for published posts
- Dry run support
- Post management and cleanup

**Dependencies**: Used by API endpoints
- RedditClient
- Database models
- Product schemas

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

- Parameter validation and error handling
- Integration with Zazzle's affiliate program

**Dependencies**: Used by commission worker and pipeline
- Zazzle templates
- Product models
- Affiliate linking

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 12. zazzle_templates.py (5.9KB, 172 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This is actively used for Zazzle template management.

**Active Functionality**:
- Template configuration data structures
- Pre-defined templates for different product types
- Template validation utilities
- Customizable field definitions

**Dependencies**: Used by zazzle_product_designer and commission worker
- Product models

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 13. pipeline_scheduler.py (3.0KB, 103 lines) - ❌ LEGACY - POTENTIAL CLEANUP

**Status**: This appears to be legacy pipeline scheduling code.

**Legacy Functionality**:
- Scheduled pipeline execution using the old `run_full_pipeline()` function
- Cron-style scheduling configuration
- Legacy pipeline job execution

**Analysis**: This scheduler uses the legacy `run_full_pipeline()` function from main.py, which appears to be replaced by the commission worker system. The commission worker handles individual commission tasks rather than scheduled bulk pipeline runs.

**Dependencies**: 
- Legacy `run_full_pipeline()` function from main.py
- Schedule library

**Potential Cleanup**: This entire file could potentially be removed if the commission worker has replaced the scheduled pipeline functionality.

### 14. content_generator.py (6.9KB, 203 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Status**: This is actively used for content generation.

**Active Functionality**:
- Content generation using OpenAI GPT models
- Single and batch content generation
- OpenAI API integration
- Content validation and error handling

**Dependencies**: Used by commission worker and pipeline
- OpenAI API
- Product models
- Usage tracking

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 15. affiliate_linker.py (4.3KB, 135 lines) - ✅ ACTIVE - NO CLEANUP NEEDED

**Conclusion**: This is actively used and no cleanup needed.

### 16. interaction_scheduler.py (4.3KB, 142 lines) - ❌ LEGACY - POTENTIAL CLEANUP

**Status**: This appears to be legacy interaction scheduling code.

**Legacy Functionality**:
- Scheduled Reddit interaction agent execution
- Product interaction processing
- Legacy interaction job scheduling

**Analysis**: This scheduler appears to be for automated Reddit interactions, but the current system focuses on commissioned products rather than automated interactions. The commission worker handles the core workflow.

**Dependencies**: 
- RedditInteractionAgent (legacy)
- Legacy interaction models

**Potential Cleanup**: This file could potentially be removed if automated interactions are not part of the current system.
