# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide for Clouvel

## Prerequisites

1. **Domain registered**: clouvel.ai (via Cloudflare)
2. **Railway account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **Environment variables**: `.env.production` file ready
4. **Railway CLI**: Will be installed automatically by script

## Quick Deployment

### 1. One-Command Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy-railway.sh
```

This script will:
- Install Railway CLI if needed
- Login to Railway
- Create project
- Set environment variables
- Deploy both API and frontend services
- Run health checks

### 2. Manual Deployment (if needed)

#### Install Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

#### Login to Railway
```bash
railway login
```

#### Create Project
```bash
railway project create clouvel
```

#### Set Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables set --file .env.production
```

#### Deploy Services
```bash
# Deploy API
railway up --service api

# Deploy frontend
cd frontend
railway up --service frontend
cd ..
```

## Environment Variables

Railway will automatically provide:
- `PORT` - Railway assigns this
- `DATABASE_URL` - If you add PostgreSQL plugin
- `REDIS_URL` - If you add Redis plugin

You need to set:
- All API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, Reddit, etc.)
- Security keys
- Email configuration
- CORS origins

## Database Setup

### Option 1: Railway PostgreSQL Plugin (Recommended)
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Add PostgreSQL plugin to your project
3. Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL`
4. Run migrations: `railway run alembic upgrade head`

### Option 2: External Database
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
- Ensure database is accessible from Railway

## Redis Setup

### Option 1: Railway Redis Plugin
1. Add Redis plugin to your project
2. Railway will automatically set `REDIS_URL`

### Option 2: External Redis
- Set `REDIS_URL` in environment variables

## Custom Domain Setup

### 1. Configure in Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your frontend service
3. Go to Settings â†’ Domains
4. Add custom domain: `clouvel.ai`

### 2. Configure DNS (Cloudflare)
Add these records:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: [Railway-provided URL]
```

```
Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Target: [Railway-provided URL]
```

### 3. SSL Certificate
- Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates
- Takes 5-10 minutes to activate

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Endpoints
- API: `https://your-api-url.railway.app/health`
- Frontend: `https://clouvel.ai/`

### Railway Dashboard
- Real-time logs
- Service metrics
- Deployment history
- Environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --service api

# Rebuild
railway up --service api
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# List all variables
railway variables

# Set individual variable
railway variables set KEY=value
```

#### Database Connection
```bash
# Test database connection
railway run python -c "from app.db.database import engine; print(engine.execute('SELECT 1').scalar())"
```

#### Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check service logs
railway logs --service api

# Restart service
railway service restart api
```

## Cost Optimization

### Railway Pricing
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month
- **Pay-per-use**: Based on actual usage
- **Estimated cost**: $20-50/month for Clouvel

### Optimization Tips
1. Use smaller instances for development
2. Scale down during low usage
3. Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
4. Set up usage alerts

## Migration from Local

### Database Migration
```bash
# Export local data (if needed)
sqlite3 data/zazzle_pipeline.db ".dump" > backup.sql

# Import to Railway PostgreSQL
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Export local environment
cat .env | grep -v "^#" > .env.production

# Edit .env.production with production values
# Then deploy to Railway
```
