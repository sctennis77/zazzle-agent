  - Stripe webhook secret (`whsec_...`)
  - OpenAI API key
  - Reddit API credentials
  - Zazzle affiliate credentials
  - Email configuration (SMTP settings)
  - Security keys (SECRET_KEY, etc.)
- [x] **Upload secrets to Railway** (done automatically by deployment script)
- [x] **Review and verify secrets in Railway dashboard** (edit as needed)

- [x] **Configure environment variables** in platform dashboard (verify after script upload)
- [x] **Project linked via CLI**
- [ ] **Set up monitoring/alerting** (UptimeRobot, etc.)

### **Phase 4: Domain & SSL (15-30 min)**
- [ ] **Configure DNS records** to point to deployment
- [ ] **Set up SSL certificate** (automatic on most platforms)
- [ ] **Test HTTPS access** and domain resolution

### **Phase 5: Final Production Testing (30-45 min)**

- [ ] **Verify Stripe payments** in live mode
- [ ] **Check Reddit integration** functionality
- [ ] **Test image generation** and upload
- [ ] **Verify email notifications** are working

### **Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (15-30 min)**
- [ ] **Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow** for automated testing
- [ ] **Configure branch protection rules** on GitHub
- [ ] **Add pre-deployment checks** (tests, linting, security)
